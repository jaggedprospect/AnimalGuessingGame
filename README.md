# AnimalGuessingGame
This is a simple guessing game that can run in the terminal of your favorite IDE! The "AI" is just a basic binary tree.

The tree is initialized with one question and two children nodes. The player can answer either "yes" or "no" to each question. 
The answer determines the path that is traversed. When a leaf node is reached, the AI will make its guess. 
If it is incorrect, the AI will ask for the name of the animal that the player was thinking of and a question that could be asked
to help the AI determine that animal in future games. 

All game data is stored externally in a text file created within the project hierarchy. If a file does not exist, one will be made.

This is a fun way to learn about binary trees, so I encourag any beginner Java programmers to download the source code and mess around with it!

There are plenty of ways that the game could be improved :)
